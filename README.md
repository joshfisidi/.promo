## Introduction 🎉

**ENS.PROMO** is a tokenized link-sharing platform built on top of Ethereum and Optimism, leveraging the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for decentralized identity and web3 integration. Users can share links to their websites and content, using web3 names as defaults, and earn rewards for engagement.

With ENS.PROMO, users can log in with their Ethereum accounts, share links with limited functionality, and unlock full platform features through a single sign-on (SSO) using Magic.link. By posting links, users utilize "promo tokens" on Optimism, with small fees for posting and profile updates.
